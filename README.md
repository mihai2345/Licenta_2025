# ðŸ§  AI-Based Image Captioning Project

This repository is part of my Bachelor's Thesis project, focusing on **automatic caption generation for images** using **Artificial Intelligence** and **Deep Learning** techniques.

The main goal of this project is to develop and evaluate different approaches for generating meaningful textual descriptions from visual data â€” starting from data preprocessing to model training and inference.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project is structured to support experimentation, modularity, and scalability.  
It includes all the core components needed for an AI-based image captioning pipeline:

1. **Data preprocessing** â€“ preparing and cleaning the dataset (images and captions)  
2. **Feature extraction** â€“ encoding visual data using neural networks or other techniques  
3. **Caption generation** â€“ decoding image representations into natural language  
4. **Evaluation and inference** â€“ testing the model and generating new captions

The project may explore different architectures such as CNNâ€“RNN, Transformer-based models, or Large Vision Models (LVMs), depending on the final research direction.
